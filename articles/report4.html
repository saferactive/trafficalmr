<p>The Saferactive project is funded by the Department for Transport.
It aims to investigate spatial and temporal patterns in road safety for active travel.</p>
<p>High quality data is available on road safety through the Stats19 dataset.
Published by the Department for Transport, this is a comprehensive dataset of road collision statistics, mainly as reported by police officers on the scene.</p>
<p>However, to estimate collision risk, we must also know the exposure, defined as the number of people walking and cycling on the road network.
The exposure acts as the denominator in any estimate of road safety risk.
The degree of uncertainty associated with estimates of exposure is high, and this uncertainty will be a key focus of the report.</p>
<p>The majority of the report focuses on cycling rather than walking.
Firstly, this is because better data is available for cycle journeys, in particular journeys to work.
Travel to work is recorded in the 2011 Census, and according to the NTS survey in 2011 it comprised around 38% of all cycle journeys but only 7% of journeys on foot.
Therefore we decided it is acceptable to use travel to work as a proxy for cycling but not for walking.
Networks of cycle counters from the Department for Transport (DfT), Transport for London (TfL) and others are also available, providing data on annual changes in cycle flows, while comparable data does not exist for walking.</p>
<p>A second reason for focusing on cycling is that since 2020 there have been large changes in how we use our streets, with unprecedented increases in cycling during the lockdown periods, accompanied in some cases by a rise in cycle casualties.
It is important to take these changes in context and to recognise that an increase in casualties does not necessarily mean an increase in risk.
This is why it is important to focus on exposure and the denominators of road safety.</p>
<p>Initially, in Section 2 we explore the input data used.
Sections 3 and 4 of this report focus on changes in casualty rates at national and regional scales, over the last decade.
Here, we can use data that covers all journey purposes.
Section 5 interrogates changes at sub-regional scales.
This is where data availability forces us to limit the scope to commuter cycling within England and Wales.
In Section 6 we again narrow the geographic scope and look at how cycle and pedestrian casualties are associated with different types of road, including a generalised definition of Low Traffic Neighbourhoods, in a West Yorkshire case study area.</p>
</div>
<div id="input-data" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#input-data" class="anchor"></a><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Input data</h1>
<p>We have used a range of nationally available datasets to estimate and visualise road safety, including Stats19 collision data, DfT traffic counts, NTS survey returns and 2011 Census commute data.</p>
<p>We have focused mainly on the decade from 2010 to 2020, but there is some variability in the years covered by different datasets.
We accessed 2020 data for collisions and DfT traffic counts, but not for all of the other datasets.
Where possible, we include data from England, Wales and Scotland.
The sub-regional analyses are only available for England and Wales since they are based on the Propensity to Cycle Tool.
NTS data are available for England only.</p>
<p>Stats19 is a comprehensive dataset of British road collision statistics, published by the DfT.
The data are collected by police forces, mostly being recorded by officers at the scene of collisions.
Casualties are classed as slight, serious or fatal.
Collisions resulting in slight injuries may not always be reported, but reporting rates for serious and fatal injuries are very high.
The key yardstick of road safety is the number of people killed or seriously injured (KSI).
In recent years there have been changes in the methodology used by many police forces to categorise injuries as slight versus serious.
Adjustment factors are used to standardise and account for these methodological changes.</p>
<p>The DfT traffic counts are a series of manual traffic counters.
Counter locations are typically surveyed from 07:00 - 19:00 on a single date per year, with seasonal adjustments applied to calculate an Annual Average Daily Flow (AADF).
However, the same locations are not surveyed each year.
Only 7% of counter locations see annual surveys 2010-2019, and very few of these locations were also surveyed in 2020.
Careful analysis is therefore required to accurately represent temporal trends.</p>
<p>NTS surveys have been conducted annually since 1988.
Results are available for each English region but not at higher geographic resolutions.
The self-reported household survey takes the form of a seven-day travel diary, and includes journeys of all purposes.
It is completed by around 15,000 individual respondents.</p>
<p>The 2011 Census provides comprehensive nationwide coverage.
Questions include method of travel to work, which can be used together with home and work locations to provide full origin-destination (OD) data for commuter journeys.
For England and Wales, the Propensity to Cycle Tool combines this data with routing algorithms created by CycleStreets.net, in particular the fast route algorithm which identifies the fastest cycle route from origin to destination, accounting for the impact of hills.</p>

<p>The number of cyclists saw a small increase over the ten years prior to 2019, according to three different data sources.</p>
<p>In 2020, the mean number of cyclists passing DfT traffic count points was three times higher than in previous years.</p>

<p>In the period 2010-2019, risk of cycle KSI has reduced according to our analysis.
This reduction has mainly occurred since 2014, and can be seen when casualty data are assessed using all three measures of cycle volume.</p>

<p>At the regional level, the most reliable data sources are the NTS and DfT regional traffic data.</p>
<p>Total distance cycled per year in each English region 2003 - 2019 (based on NTS survey)</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52210872/133634243-6449b3c1-61dd-429c-bc41-562841968ff4.png"><!-- --></p>
<p>Total distance cycled per year in each region 2010 - 2020 (including Scotland and Wales), based on DfT regional traffic data.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52210872/138102424-717a763f-1ec9-4675-80a1-38d9138e4fa0.png"><!-- --></p>
<p>Data from individual DfT traffic counters, unlike the sources shown in the two previous figures, are available for analysis at sub-regional levels.
Therefore, for comparative purposes we show regional aggregations of the traffic counter data.
Firstly, we look at mean cycle flows per DfT counter in each region.
These are all Annual Average Daily Flows (AADF), calculated by the DfT to account for the impact of seasonality on the raw counter flows.
To allow easy comparison between regions, we normalised these as percentage change since 2011.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52210872/132316899-1bbc1cc9-687e-4df3-9c7a-3074778dd107.png"><!-- --></p>
<p>Count locations change from year to year, which could be causing some of observed flux in these regional mean values.
As another approach, we look at mean change in AADF cycle flow per DfT counter in each region (including Scotland and Wales).
This is based on the change in flow at each counter, calculated as the flow for a particular year minus the minimum annual flow for the given counter.
Again, these are normalised as percentage change since 2011.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52210872/133624726-227a7114-0fb1-4f62-bd06-a139f7245b60.png"><!-- --></p>
<p>The low observed mean flows in 2018 and 2019 in the previous figure can be explained by the fact that many additional counts were undertaken on â€˜Câ€™ and Unclassified roads in these years.
If these are new locations, the minimum flow for the count location will necessarily be recorded in one of these years.</p>

<p>We investigate trends in KSI, exposure and risk for commuter cycling at the geographical scales of Upper Tier Local Authorities and Police Force areas.
Data related to KSI and km cycled are available for the years 2010 - 2020, while data related to population estimates, such as km cycled per capita, are available for the years 2010 - 2019.</p>
<p>KSI and risk data are estimated based on the number of cyclists killed and seriously injured during weekday peak hours (07:00-10:00 and 16:00-19:00), and estimates of km cycled derived from Census 2011 travel to work by bicycle.
These journeys are routed using the CycleStreets.net fast routes algorithm, as used in the Propensity to Cycle Tool.</p>
<p>For all other years, we adjust the 2011 commuter cycle flows using DfT counter data, based on mean AADF counts within the relevant geographical zone.
As a baseline for the annual adjustments of cycle flows, we reduce volatility by using the mean AADF flows in a three year period centered on 2011, e.g:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Km_{2020} =  Km_{2011} * (AADF_{2020} / (Mean(AADF_{2010}, AADF_{2011}, AADF_{2012})))
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(Km_{2020}\)</span> = estimated km cycled for travel to work in 2020; <span class="math inline">\(Km_{2011}\)</span> = km cycled for travel to work in 2011; <span class="math inline">\(AADF_{2020}\)</span> = mean AADF of DfT counters within the geographical region in 2020; <span class="math inline">\(AADF_{2010}\)</span> = mean AADF in 2010; <span class="math inline">\(AADF_{2011}\)</span> = mean AADF in 2011; and <span class="math inline">\(AADF_{2012}\)</span> = mean AADF in 2012.</p>

<a href="#low-traffic-neighbourhoods-and-rat-runs" class="anchor"></a><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Low Traffic Neighbourhoods and rat-runs</h1>
<p>Traffic levels on minor roads have increased dramatically in recent years, by 26% nationwide compared with only 9% on A roads, according to DfTâ€™s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/916749/road-traffic-estimates-in-great-britain-2019.pdf">official statistics</a>.
Many factors influence road safety, but since the coronavirus pandemic modal filters and other traffic calming interventions in residential areas have come to the fore, explaining our focus on residential interventions in this section.</p>
<p>Although the phrase â€˜Low Traffic Neighbourhoodâ€™ is a recent invention, the concept is not new.
Modal filters preventing vehicle movement along a street while allowing passage to pedestrians and cyclists have existed for many decades.
They can take a wide range of forms, such as bollards, gaps, and continuations of pavement across the entrances of side streets.</p>
<p>It can also be argued that any street, or any network of streets, which does not provide a vehicle connection between two main roads, is in effect part of a low traffic neighbourhood.
These streets do not provide worthwhile opportunities for ratrunning, so they are likely to be used mainly by residents and those wishing to access destinations on the street itself.
This includes cul-de-sacs and wider networks of streets for which all of the access points are on the same main road.</p>
<p>Using this definition of low traffic neighbourhoods, CycleStreets.net have created a nationwide beta map of LTNs.
All roads are assigned as main roads, low traffic neighbourhood roads, ratruns, or ratruns with traffic calming measures.
Main roads are those classified as â€˜Aâ€™, â€˜Bâ€™ or â€˜Câ€™ roads. Data on traffic calming measures are obtained from OSM.</p>
<p>This map extract from Leeds gives an example of how roads are classified.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52210872/137929708-99296ffc-07c9-4c12-b052-e2a3e14d7cdb.png"><!-- --></p>
<p>We have used this beta map with West Yorkshire as a case study region, to assess the impact of Low Traffic Neighbourhoods on road safety.</p>

<p>For this case study we have divided the West Yorkshire road network into a set of 1km grid cells.
We see a clear correlation between total road length within each 1km cell and the number of pedestrian KSI over the period 2010-2019.</p>

</div>
<p>There is also a positive association between road length and cycle KSI but it is weaker, likely reflecting the fact that the cycling distribution is more uneven than the pedestrian distribution.</p>

<p>Switching to maps, we can see how these patterns play out across West Yorkshire.
The greatest concentration of cycle and walking KSI are found in the urban areas such as Leeds and Bradford.
Cycle commute km are strongly concentrated within Leeds.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Now looking at the distribution of KSI risk, we see that for walking, KSI risk per km road remains highest in the urban areas, especially Bradford.
For cycling, KSI risk per km road has a slightly more scattered distribution with high values in Leeds.
However, when we use Bkm cycled as the denominator, the map is very different. Now some of the lowest rates are found in Leeds.
This map shows very high KSI rates in some of the Pennine fringes of West Yorkshire, but these are probably artefacts of the fact that we are using commuter cycling as the denominator, while leisure and sport cycling dominate in these areas.
A more reliable finding is that KSI risk appears higher in Bradford than in Leeds.</p>

<p>The next step is to investigate how these patterns relate to the distribution of road types.
Unsurprisingly, the total road length within each 1km grid cell varies greatly across the region, being highest in towns and cities, but so too does the distribution of types of road within each grid cell.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52210872/137931151-74a946aa-11a8-4989-be58-db89206792c0.png"><!-- --></p>
<p>Weighting by the road length within a grid cell, we look at how pedestrian and cyclist KSI vary with the proportion of roads of different types.
We expect that KSI rates will increase as the proportion of ratruns increases, and decrease as the proportion of LTNs increases.</p>

<p>Rather than one simple answer to the question of how to measure road safety risk, it is clear that there are many different ways of approaching this topic.
We have focused mainly on risk related to cycle commuting, which has some of the best data quality, but even here different data sources will provide different interpretations.</p>
<p>This uncertainty must be understood in the context that to assess risk, we need measures of both casualty rates and exposure.
The casualty data is comprehensive and the core stats19 components (such as number of casualties) are highly reliable.
Therefore it is uncertainty in the exposure, i.e.Â the number of km cycled on the roads, that is the most important factor.</p>

<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#uncertainty-in-spatial-trends" class="anchor"></a><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Uncertainty in spatial trends</h2>
<p>When it comes to travel to work, we have comprehensive knowledge of spatial trends in cycling through the 2011 Census. Certain uncertainties remain even here, since we do not know the actual routes used to travel between origin and destination, but the CycleStreets.net fast algorithm provides a good approximation of these.</p>
<p>However, this only holds true for travel to work, which in 2011 accounted for 38% of cycle journeys.
Similarly comprehensive data exists for travel to school, but not for other purposes such as leisure, personal business and shopping.
In particular, leisure cycling accounted for 34% of journeys in 2011 and is likely to have considerably different spatial patterns to commuter cycling.
In addition, we do not yet have evidence relating to multimodal journeys such as combined cycle-rail journeys.</p>
<p>For the sub-regional analyses in this report, one of the most prominent impacts of the uncertainty in spatial trends relates to this lack of data on other journey purposes.
We have focused on travel to work by only counting collisions that occur during peak commute hours, but nevertheless, even during those hours not all journeys will be for commuting.
Therefore, in the sub-regional analyses we will have overestimated KSI risk everywhere, but especially in places where commuting is a relatively smaller proportion of total cycle journeys.
This could potentially explain the high risk rates seen in areas such as rural Wales, the fringes of London, the South Coast and the Pennines, which may have relatively high proportions of leisure/sport cycling.</p>
<p>The reliance on Census data which is now ten years old also means that spatial trends will not account for new build developments, although flows from these sites may be included in the traffic counter data for more recent years.</p>

<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#uncertainty-in-temporal-trends" class="anchor"></a><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Uncertainty in temporal trends</h2>
<p>The spatial trends described above hold true for 2011, when the Census was conducted.
When analysing change through time before and after this date, there is uncertainty related the measures used to assess change in cycling.
At the regional level, it is possible to use DfT regional traffic data and NTS survey returns, but these are not available at higher geographic resolutions.</p>
<p>The sub-regional analyses rely on Annual Average Daily Flows derived from DfT traffic counters as a basis for estimating change through time.
However, a key limitation is that the count locations are not consistent from year to year.
Some locations see counts every year, but most do not, leading to a proponderance of missing data which impacts on observed trends.</p>
<p>In addition, counts are undertaken on a variety of road types, from trunk â€˜Aâ€™ roads to â€˜Câ€™ and unclassified roads.
Expected cycle flows differ by road type.
Both nationally and within a Local Authority, the number and proportion of counts that are located on roads of each type varies from year to year.<br>
This causes inter-annual flux in observed cycle flows which can mask underlying trends.
The result of these factors is that the mean AADF for counters within a given geographic area is inherently unstable from year to year.</p>
<!-- Todo: add discussion emperical Bayes and data scarcity -->
<!-- ## Impact of data scarcity -->
<!-- Smaller Local Authority may have both few accidents per year and few DfT counter locations.  -->
