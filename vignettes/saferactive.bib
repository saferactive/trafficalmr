  abstract = {TensorFlow is an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms, and an implementation for executing such algorithms. A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google. The TensorFlow API and a reference implementation were released as an open-source package under the Apache 2.0 license in November, 2015 and are available at www.tensorflow.org.},

Covariates include socio-demographics, weather conditions, transportation infrastructure and amount of travel. FB hierarchical models are generally consistent with the NB estimates. Counties with a higher percentage of the population under poverty level, higher percentage of their population in age groups 0\textendash 14, 15\textendash 24, and over 64 and those with increased road mileage and road density have significantly increased crash risk. Total precipitation is significant and positive in the NB models, but not significant with FB. Spatial correlation, time trend, and space\textendash time interactions are significant in the FB injury crash models. County-level FB models reveal the existence of spatial correlation in crash data and provide a mechanism to quantify, and reduce the effect of, this correlation. Addressing spatial correlation is likely to be even more important in road segment and intersection-level crash models, where spatial correlation is likely to be even more pronounced.},

This book provides students in urban transportation, planners and city authorities with requisite knowledge on the causes and the extent to which traffic congestion in Accra, Ghana's capital, conspired with other factors to thwart efforts at improving public transport through the bus rapid transit system.  The book has meticulously triangulated data and theoretical sources, including GIS-based techniques; key informant(in-depth)\& semi-  structured interviews,in addition to the Time-Geographic, Structuration and General Systems theories.  While Accra's intractable traffic congestion primarily collapsed the time-bound express bus service, other unfavorable factors are identified as well.  Thus, efforts by policy makers and planners to curb congestion and improve public transport must entail congestion pricing, proper traffic accidents management and the implementation of a comprehensive land-use-transportation-system master plan.},

  abstract = {Cycling injury risk is an important topic, but few studies explore cycling risk in relation to exposure. This is largely because of a lack of exposure data, in other words how much cycling is done at different locations. This paper helps to fill this gap. It reports a case-control study of cycling injuries in London in 2013\textendash 2014, using modelled cyclist flow data alongside datasets covering some characteristics of the London route network. A multilevel binary logistic regression model is used to investigate factors associated with injury risk, comparing injury sites with control sites selected using the modelled flow data. Findings provide support for `safety in numbers': for each increase of a natural logarithmic unit (2.71828) in cycling flows, an 18\% decrease in injury odds was found. Conversely, increased motor traffic volume is associated with higher odds of cycling injury, with one logarithmic unit increase associated with a 31\% increase in injury odds. Twenty-mile per hour compared with 30mph speed limits were associated with 21\% lower injury odds. Residential streets were associated with reduced injury odds, and junctions with substantially higher injury odds. Bus lanes do not affect injury odds once other factors are controlled for. These data suggest that speed limits of 20 mph may reduce cycling injury risk, as may motor traffic reduction. Further, building cycle routes that generate new cycle trips should generate `safety in numbers' benefits.},

We find larger effects (decreased car ownership and use, increased active travel) in intervention areas where Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) were introduced. Decreased car ownership and use is only found in such areas. Sample size for LTN areas is small and hence uncertainty about effect magnitude is large, but effect direction is consistent. This suggests that to reduce car use as well as increase active travel, LTNs are an important part of the intervention toolbox.},

  abstract = {We are interested in a class of unsupervised methods to detect possible disease outbreaks, that is, rapid increases in the number of cases of a particular disease that deviate from the pattern observed in the past. The motivating application for this article deals with detecting outbreaks using generalized additive models (GAMs) to model weekly counts of certain infectious diseases. We can use the distance between the predicted and observed counts for a specific week to determine whether an important departure has occurred. Unfortunately, this approach may not work as desired because GAMs can be very sensitive to the presence of a small proportion of observations that deviate from the assumed model. Thus, the outbreak may affect the predicted values causing these to be close to the atypical counts, and thus mask the outliers by having them appear not to be too extreme or atypical. We illustrate this phenomenon with influenza-like-illness doctor-visits data from the United States for the 2006\textendash 2008 flu seasons. One way to avoid this masking problem is to derive an algorithm to fit GAM models that can resist the effect of a small number of atypical observations. In this article we discuss such an outlier-robust fit for GAMs based on the backfitting algorithm. The basic idea is to replace the maximum likelihood based weights used in the generalized local scoring algorithm with those derived from robust quasi-likelihood equations (Cantoni and Ronchetti 2001b). These robust estimators for generalized linear models work well for the Poisson family of distributions, and also for binomial distributions with relatively large numbers of trials. We show that the resulting estimated mean function is resistant to the presence of outliers in the response variable and that it also remains close to the usual GAM estimator when the data do not contain atypical observations. We illustrate the use of this approach on the detection of the recent outbreak of H1N1 flu by looking at the weekly counts of influenza-like-illness (ILI) doctor visits, as reported through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), and also apply our method to the numbers of requested isolates in Canada. Weeks with a sudden increase in ILI visits or requested isolates are much more clearly identified as atypical by the robust fit because the observed counts are far from the ones predicted by the fitted GAM model.},

The pandemic drove a mass social experiment in which half of all paid hours were provided from home between May and October 2020. Our survey evidence says that 22 percent of all full work days will be supplied from home after the pandemic ends, compared with just 5 percent before. We provide evidence on five mechanisms behind this persistent shift to working from home: diminished stigma, better-than-expected experiences working from home, investments in physical and human capital enabling working from home, reluctance to return to pre-pandemic activities, and innovation supporting working from home. We also examine some implications of a persistent shift in working arrangements: First, high-income workers, especially, will enjoy the perks of working from home. Second, we forecast that the postpandemic shift to working from home will lower worker spending in major city centers by 5 to 10 percent. Third, many workers report being more productive at home than on business premises, so post-pandemic work from home plans offer the potential to raise productivity as much as 2.4 percent.},

  abstract = {Background: Understanding factors that influence the distance that drivers provide when passing cyclists is critical to reducing subjective risk and improving cycling participation. This study aimed to quantify passing distance and assess the impact of motor vehicle and road infrastructure characteristics on passing distance. Methods: An on-road observational study was conducted in Victoria, Australia. Participants had a custom device installed on their bicycle and rode as per their usual cycling for one to two weeks. A hierarchical linear model was used to investigate the relationship between motor vehicle and infrastructure characteristics (location, presence of on-road marked bicycle lane and the presence of parked cars on the kerbside) and passing distance (defined as the lateral distance between the end of the bicycle handlebars and the passing motor vehicle). Results: Sixty cyclists recorded 18,527 passing events over 422 trips. The median passing distance was 173\,cm (Q1: 137\,cm, Q3: 224\,cm) and 1085 (5.9\%) passing events were less than 100\,cm. Relative to sedans, 4WDs had a reduced mean passing distance of 15\,cm (Q1: 12\,cm, Q3: 17\,cm) and buses had a reduced mean passing distance of 28\,cm (Q1: 16\,cm, Q3: 40\,cm). Relative to passing events that occurred on roads without a marked bicycle lane and without parked cars, passing events on roads with a bike lane with no parked cars had a reduced mean passing distance of 27\,cm (Q1: 25\,cm, Q3: 29\,cm), and passing events on roads with a bike lane and parked cars had a mean lower passing distance of 40\,cm (Q1: 37\,cm, Q3: 43\,cm). Conclusions: One in every 17 passing events was a close ({$<$}100\,cm) passing event. We identified that on-road bicycle lanes and parked cars reduced passing distance. These data can be used to inform the selection and design of cycling-related infrastructure and road use with the aim of improving safety for cyclists.},

It is recognised that large buses hold the promise of relieving the growing congestion of African cities if they are managed efficiently and sustainably. It is in line with this that this study seeks to explore the reasons behind commuters' non-preference of Metro Mass Transit (MMT) for intra-city commuting in Accra, Ghana. A revealed preference survey was administered to 134 commuters to find out the reasons behind their non-preference and their perception of the level of service (LOS) delivery of the Metro Mass Transit. The Study revealed that though Metro Mass Transit was 20\% cheaper in terms of price, commuters perceived its service delivery as poor. Over-crowding of buses, non-adherence to time schedule, long in-vehicle time, perception of not getting access to seats, non-availability of bus at respondents' origins and destinations, accessibility of alternative modes and long waiting times for buses accounted for the major reasons for non-preference. Metro Mass Transit Limited's improvement in its service attributes especially in-vehicle time, waiting time, comfort, reliability and accessibility is a means of increasing its modal share. Adherence to these is the surest way to achieving the objective of promoting mass transit in Accra by shifting people from the use of unsustainable modes such as mini-buses and taxis to the use of efficient high capacity systems as Metro Mass Transit.},

  abstract = {Background: Cycling is perceived as an unsafe travel mode in many countries. However, road deaths in England have fallen sharply since 2007. We explored whether differences in fatality rates by age, gender and mode persist, and the associations of deprivation with these. Methods: Using ONS (cycling, pedestrian) and Stats19 (driving) 2007\textendash 2012 data for travel-related deaths, including pedestrian falls, and National Travel Surveys 2007\textendash 2012 travel data, we calculated fatality rates for England by distance (f/bnkm) and time travelled (million hours' use, f/mhu) by age, travel mode, and gender or residential Index of Multiple Deprivation. Results: Fatality rates fell significantly 2007\textendash 2009 to 2010\textendash 2012: male f/bnkm from 2.8 (95\%CI 2.7\textendash 2.9) to 2.0 (1.9\textendash 2.1) for driving; 32.1 (28.5\textendash 36.0) to 20.8 (18.1\textendash 23.9) for cycling; and 51.4 (48.5\textendash 54.4) to 36.7 (34.3\textendash 39.3) for walking. Fatality rates varied by age, gender, and mode. Driving and walking fatality rate ratios were generally higher for males than females. For males 17\textendash 20y, fatality rates were 0.76 (0.69\textendash 0.83)/mhu for driving and 0.28 (0.18\textendash 0.42)/mhu for cycling but were similar by distance. Age-specific rates were J-shape for cycling, U-shape for driving, and increased exponentially with age for walking. Fatality rates aged 80+ were an order of magnitude higher in each mode than the all-age mean. Compared with those aged 17\textendash 20, rate ratios were significantly lower for male drivers 21+ and female drivers 21\textendash 74, but were higher for male cyclists aged 55+ and pedestrians 45+ (male) and 65+ (female). People living in the most deprived quintile generally had higher fatality rates than those in the least deprived quintile overall (three modes combined) and for walking but not for cycling; Rate ratios were highest for pedestrians 35\textendash 64 and drivers 35\textendash 54. Conclusions: Fatality rates for walking, cycling and driving are higher for males than females at almost every age and vary more by age than by travel mode. Deprivation exacerbates walking and driving fatality rates.},

  abstract = {Mobile phone data have been extensively used to study urban mobility. However, studies based on gender-disaggregated large-scale data are still lacking, limiting our understanding of gendered aspects of urban mobility and our ability to design policies for gender equality. Here we study urban mobility from a gendered perspective, combining commercial and open datasets for the city of Santiago, Chile. We analyze call detail records for a large cohort of anonymized mobile phone users and reveal a gender gap in mobility: women visit fewer unique locations than men, and distribute their time less equally among such locations. Mapping this mobility gap over administrative divisions, we observe that a wider gap is associated with lower income and lack of public and private transportation options. Our results uncover a complex interplay between gendered mobility patterns, socio-economic factors and urban affordances, calling for further research and providing insights for policymakers and urban planners.},

  abstract = {Background The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is a freely available, interactive tool help prioritise cycling initially launched in England in 2017 and based on adult commuting data. This paper applies the method to travel to school data, and assesses health and carbon benefits based on nationwide scenarios of cycling uptake. Methods The 2011 National School Census provides origin-destination data for all state-funded schools in England (N = 7,442,532 children aged 2\textendash 18 in 21,443 schools). Using this dataset, we modelled propensity to cycle as a function of route distance and hilliness between home and school. We generated scenarios, including `Go Dutch' \textendash{} in which English children were as likely to cycle as Dutch children, accounting for trip distance and hilliness. We estimated changes in the level of cycling, walking, and driving, and associated impacts on physical activity and carbon emissions. Results In 2011, 1.8\% of children cycled to school (1.0\% in primary school, 2.7\% in secondary school). If Dutch levels of cycling were reached, under the Go Dutch scenario, this would rise to 41.0\%, a 22-fold increase. This is larger than the 6-fold increase in Go Dutch for adult commuting. This would increase total physical activity among pupils by 57\%, and reduce transport-related carbon emissions by 81 kilotonnes/year. These impacts would be substantially larger in secondary schools than primary schools (a 96\% vs. 9\% increase in physical activity, respectively). Conclusion Cycling to school is uncommon in England compared with other Northern European countries. Trip distances and hilliness alone cannot explain the difference, suggesting substantial unmet potential. We show that policies resulting in substantial uptake of cycling to school would have important health and environmental benefits. At the level of road networks, the results can inform local investment in safe routes to school to help realise these potential benefits.},

  abstract = {Intervention studies suggest that changing the built environment may encourage a modal shift from car travel towards active travel. However, little is known about the detail of patterns of changes in travel behaviour. Adult commuters working in Cambridge (UK) completed annual questionnaires between 2009 and 2012. Commuting was assessed using a validated seven-day travel-to-work record. The intervention consisted of the opening of a guided busway with a path for walking and cycling in 2011. Exposure to the intervention was defined as the negative of the square root of the shortest road distance from home to the busway. We investigated the association between exposure to the intervention and specific modal shifts and patterns of change, along with individual mode choice patterns over the entire four-year period. Five groups of patterns of change were found in our in-depth explorations: (1) no change, (2) a full modal shift, (3) a partial modal shift, (4) non-stable but patterned behaviour, and (5) complicated or apparently random patterns. A minority of participants had a directed change of either a full modal shift or, more commonly, a partial modal shift, whereas a large proportion showed a highly variable pattern. No significant associations were found between exposure to the intervention and specific modal shifts or patterns of change. Our analyses revealed a large diversity in (changes in) travel behaviour patterns over time, and showed that the intervention did not result in one specific pattern of behaviour change or produce only full modal shifts. These insights are important for improving the measurement of travel behaviour, improving our understanding of how changes in travel behaviour patterns occur, and fully capturing the potential impacts of interventions.},

Building upon a detailed examination of one important social experiment - the Public Consultation on Developments in the Biosciences - the social construction of both science and public consultation is considered. With particular attention to the framing of issues for public debate, the constitution of audience and the construction of citizenship, the paper argues the need to move beyond mere sloganizing over science and democracy.

  abstract = {Objective To examine the relationship between the numbers of people walking or bicycling and the frequency of collisions between motorists and walkers or bicyclists. The common wisdom holds that the number of collisions varies directly with the amount of walking and bicycling. However, three published analyses of collision rates at specific intersections found a non-linear relationship, such that collisions rates declined with increases in the numbers of people walking or bicycling. Data This paper uses five additional data sets (three population level and two time series) to compare the amount of walking or bicycling and the injuries incurring in collisions with motor vehicles. Results The likelihood that a given person walking or bicycling will be struck by a motorist varies inversely with the amount of walking or bicycling. This pattern is consistent across communities of varying size, from specific intersections to cities and countries, and across time periods. Discussion This result is unexpected. Since it is unlikely that the people walking and bicycling become more cautious if their numbers are larger, it indicates that the behavior of motorists controls the likelihood of collisions with people walking and bicycling. It appears that motorists adjust their behavior in the presence of people walking and bicycling. There is an urgent need for further exploration of the human factors controlling motorist behavior in the presence of people walking and bicycling. Conclusion A motorist is less likely to collide with a person walking and bicycling if more people walk or bicycle. Policies that increase the numbers of people walking and bicycling appear to be an effective route to improving the safety of people walking and bicycling.},

  abstract = {Objective: To introduce a conceptual structure that can be used to organise the evidence base for Health Impact Assessment (HIA). Background: HIA can be used to judge the potential health effects of a policy, programme or project on a population, and the distribution of those effects. Progress has been made in incorporating HIA into routine practice, especially (in the UK) at local level. However, these advances have mainly been restricted to process issues, including policy engagement and community involvement, while the evidence base has been relatively neglected. Relating policies to their impact on health: The key distinctive feature of HIA is that determinants of health are not taken as given, but rather as factors that themselves have determinants. Nine ways are distinguished in which evidence on health and its determinants can be related to policy, and examples are given from the literature. The most complete of these is an analysis of health effects in the context of a comparison of options. A simple model, the policy/risk assessment model (PRAM), is introduced as a framework that relates changes in levels of exposures or other risk factors to changes in health status. This approach allows a distinction to be made between the technical process of HIA and the political process of decision making, which involves lines of accountability. Extension of the PRAM model to complex policy areas and its adaptation to non-quantitative examples are discussed. Issues for the future: A sound evidence base is essential to the long term reputation of HIA. Research gaps are discussed, especially the need for evidence connecting policy options with changes in determinants of health. It is proposed that policy options could be considered as ``exposure'' variables in research. The methodology needs to be developed in the course of work on specific issues, concentrated in policy areas that are relatively tractable. Conclusions: A system of coordination needs to be established, at national or supranational level, building on existing initiatives. The framework suggested in this paper can be used to collate and evaluate what is already known, both to identify gaps where research is required and to enable an informed judgement to be made about the potential health impacts of policy options. These judgements should be made widely available for policy makers and for those undertaking health impact assessment.},

A transport model is used to single out data on commuting preferences in the County Stockholm. Our analysis shows there is a very large potential for reducing emissions and exposure if all car drivers living within a distance corresponding to a maximum of a 30min bicycle ride to work would change to commuting by bicycle. It would result in {$>$}111,000 new cyclists, corresponding to an increase of 209\% compared to the current situation. Mean population exposure would be reduced by about 7\% for both NOx and black carbon (BC) in the most densely populated area of the inner city of Stockholm. Applying a relative risk for NOx of 8\% decrease in all-cause mortality associated with a 10{$\mu$}gm-3 decrease in NOx, this corresponds to {$>$}449 (95\% CI: 340\textendash 558) years of life saved annually for the Stockholm county area with 2.1 million inhabitants. This is more than double the effect of the reduced mortality estimated for the introduction of congestion charge in Stockholm in 2006. Using NO2 or BC as indicator of health impacts, we obtain 395 (95\% CI: 172\textendash 617) and 185 (95\% CI: 158\textendash 209) years of life saved for the population, respectively. The calculated exposure of BC and its corresponding impacts on mortality are likely underestimated. With this in mind the estimates using NOx, NO2 and BC show quite similar health impacts considering the 95\% confidence intervals.},

It will be argued that deficiencies in the present road design philosophy are the main cause of the global road safety crisis, clearly indicating its man-made nature. A brief description is made of the decision process leading to the establishment of Vision Zero as Sweden's Traffic Safety Policy in 1997. Following an analysis of the problem, suggestions are made for finding solutions. The solutions are based on some of the principles in Vision Zero. They include a new basic mechanism for creating error-tolerance in the road system, and new design principles for road- and street design. The tradition of ``blaming the victim'' is hereby questioned and focus is put on the need for professionals to act based on these new standards. During the last 10 years the fatalities in Sweden have dropped from approximately 550/year to 450/year. Roads redesigned with median barriers have an 80\% reduction in fatalities. Streets with 30km/h design speed show similar results. This indicates that measures derived from Vision Zero strategy are effective but that large scale implementation has not yet been done.},

We analyzed the frequencies of R packages reported in more than 60,000 peer-reviewed articles published in 30 ecology journals during a 10-yr period ending in 2017. The number of studies reported using R as their primary tool in data analysis increased linearly from 11.4\% in 2008 to 58.0\% in 2017. The top 10 packages reported were lme4, vegan, nlme, ape, MuMIn, MASS, mgcv, ade4, multcomp, and car. The increasing popularity of R has most likely furthered open science in ecological research because it can improve reproducibility of analyses and captures workflows when scripts and codes are included and shared. These findings may not be entirely unique to R because there are other programming languages used by ecologists, but they do strongly suggest that given the relatively high frequency of reported use of R, it is a significant component of contemporary analytics in the field of ecology.},

Multinomial logistic regression assessed associations between sociodemographic factors and mode of transport to work. Linear and logistic regression was used to examine associations between mode of travel and overweight/obesity, and having hypertension or diabetes. Results A total of 69\% of participants traveled to work using private transport, with public transport, walking, and cycling used by 16\%, 12\%, and 3\%, respectively. Use of any active travel was more likely in participants living in London. Black participants were more likely to walk (AOR=1.41, 95\% CI=1.08, 1.84) or take public transport (AOR=2.34, 95\% CI=1.88, 2.90) to work than whites. Using public transport, walking, or cycling to work was associated with a lower likelihood of being overweight (AOR=0.80, 95\% CI=0.54, 0.88 for walking). Walking or cycling was associated with a lower likelihood of having diabetes, and walking was associated with a lower likelihood of having hypertension than private transport (AOR=0.83, 95\% CI=0.71, 0.97). Conclusions There are wide variations in the mode of travel to work across regions and sociodemographic groups in the UK. The protective association between active travel and cardiovascular risk demonstrated in this nationally representative study adds to growing evidence that concerted policy focus in this area may benefit population health. ?? 2013 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

  abstract = {Getting people cycling is an increasingly common objective in transport planning institutions worldwide. A growing evidence base indicates that high quality infrastructure can boost local cycling rates. Yet for infrastructure and other cycling measures to be effective, it is important to intervene in the right places, such as along `desire lines' of high latent demand. This creates the need for tools and methods to help answer the question `where to build?'. Following a brief review of the policy and research context related to this question, this paper describes the design, features and potential applications of such a tool. The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is an online, interactive planning support system that was initially developed to explore and map cycling potential across England (see www.pct.bike). Based on origin-destination data it models cycling levels at area, desire line, route and route network levels, for current levels of cycling, and for scenario-based `cycling futures.' Four scenarios are presented, including `Go Dutch' and `Ebikes,' which explore what would happen if English people had the same propensity to cycle as Dutch people and the potential impact of electric cycles on cycling uptake. The cost effectiveness of investment depends not only on the number of additional trips cycled, but on wider impacts such as health and carbon benefits. The PCT reports these at area, desire line, and route level for each scenario. The PCT is open source, facilitating the creation of scenarios and deployment in new contexts. We conclude that the PCT illustrates the potential of online tools to inform transport decisions and raises the wider issue of how models should be used in transport planning.},

  abstract = {Over the last fifty years, research into street networks has gained prominence with a rapidly growing number of studies across disparate disciplines. These studies investigate a wide range of phenomena using a wealth of data and diverse analytical techniques. Starting within the fields of transport or infrastructure engineering, street networks have commonly been treated as sets of more or less homogeneous linear elements, connecting locations and intersecting at junctions. This view is commonly represented as a graph, which provides a common and rigorous formalisation accessible across disciplines and is particularly well-suited for problems such as flow optimisation and routing. Street networks are, however, complex objects of investigation and the way we model and then represent them as graphs has fundamental effects on the outcomes of a study. Many approaches to modelling street networks have been proposed, each lending itself to different analyses and supporting insights into diverse aspects of the urban system. Yet, this plurality and the relation between different models remains relatively obscure and unexplored. The motivations for adopting a given model of the network are also not always clear and often seem to follow disciplinary traditions. This paper provides an overview of key street network models and the prima facie merits of pertinent alternative approaches. It suggests greater attention to consistent use of terms and concepts, of graph representations and practical applications, and concludes with suggestions for possible ways forward.},

  abstract = {Small multiples enable comparison by providing different views of a single data set in a dense and aligned manner. A common frame defines each view, which varies based upon values of a conditioning variable. An increasingly popular use of this technique is to project two-dimensional locations into a gridded space (e.g. grid maps), using the underlying distribution both as the conditioning variable and to determine the grid layout. Using whitespace in this layout has the potential to carry information, especially in a geographic context. Yet, the effects of doing so on the spatial properties of the original units are not understood. We explore the design space offered by such small multiples with gaps. We do so by constructing a comprehensive suite of metrics that capture properties of the layout used to arrange the small multiples for comparison (e.g. compactness and alignment) and the preservation of the original data (e.g. distance, topology and shape). We study these metrics in geographic data sets with varying properties and numbers of gaps. We use simulated annealing to optimize for each metric and measure the effects on the others. To explore these effects systematically, we take a new approach, developing a system to visualize this design space using a set of interactive matrices. We find that adding small amounts of whitespace to small multiple arrays improves some of the characteristics of 2D layouts, such as shape, distance and direction. This comes at the cost of other metrics, such as the retention of topology. Effects vary according to the input maps, with degree of variation in size of input regions found to be a factor. Optima exist for particular metrics in many cases, but at different amounts of whitespace for different maps. We suggest multiple metrics be used in optimized layouts, finding topology to be a primary factor in existing manually-crafted solutions, followed by a trade-off between shape and displacement. But the rich range of possible optimized layouts leads us to challenge single-solution thinking; we suggest to consider alternative optimized layouts for small multiples with gaps. Key to our work is the systematic, quantified and visual approach to exploring design spaces when facing a trade-off between many competing criteria\textemdash an approach likely to be of value to the analysis of other design spaces.},

Despite the evidence, transportation planning practice does not fully account for this phenomenon, with the result that estimates of the potential congestion-reducing benefits of added highway capacity may be overstated and estimates of potential environmental impacts understated. In 2015, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) sponsored a review of applicable induced vehicle travel research that could inform transportation analysis guidance in response to new laws in California such as Senate Bill 743 (S.B. 743), which prohibits the use of vehicle level of service (LOS) and similar measures as the sole basis for determining significant transportation impacts under the California Environmental Quality Act. Instead, vehicle miles traveled was selected to replace LOS under S.B. 743, and along with the new metric there will be a requirement to account for induced travel effects in analysis of roadway capacity expansion projects. The Caltrans review revealed an inconsistent lexicon in academic research and among practitioners, questions about research applicability, limitations in the sensitivity of travel forecasting models, and confusion about the appropriate use of induced vehicle travel elasticities from research. This paper summarizes the Caltrans review and shares the findings to advance understanding of induced vehicle travel effects and suggest steps for additional research.},

  abstract = {Background  Official reports on modal risk have not chosen appropriate numerators and denominators to enable like-for-like comparisons. We report age- and sex-specific deaths and injury rates from equivalent incidents in England by travel mode, distance travelled and time spent travelling.    Methods  Hospital admissions and deaths in England 2007\textendash 2009 were obtained for relevant ICD-10 external codes for pedestrians, cyclists, and car/van drivers, by age-group and sex. Distance travelled by age-group, sex and mode in England (National Travel Survey 2007\textendash 2009 data) was converted to time spent travelling using mean trip speeds. Fatality rates were compared with age-specific Netherlands data.    Results  All-age fatalities per million hours' use (f/mhu) varied over the same factor-of-three range for both sexes (0.15\textendash 0.45 f/mhu by mode for men, 0.09\textendash 0.31 f/mhu for women). Risks were similar for men aged 21\textendash 49 y for all three modes and for female pedestrians and drivers aged 21\textendash 69 y. Most at risk were: males 17\textendash 20 y (1.3 f/mhu (95\% CI 1.2\textendash 1.4)) for driving; males 70+ (2.2 f/mhu(1.6\textendash 3.0)) for cycling; and females 70+ (0.95 f/mhu (0.86\textendash 1.1)) for pedestrians. In general, fatality rates were substantially higher among males than females. Risks per hour for male drivers \&lt;30 y were similar or higher than for male cyclists; for males aged 17\textendash 20 y, the risk was higher for drivers (33/Bn km (30\textendash 36), 1.3 f/mhu (1.2\textendash 1.4)) than cyclists (20/Bn km (10\textendash 37), 0.24 f/mhu (0.12\textendash 0.45)) whether using distance or time. Similar age patterns occurred for cyclists and drivers in the Netherlands. Age-sex patterns for injuries resulting in hospital admission were similar for cyclists and pedestrians but lower for drivers.    Conclusions  When all relevant ICD-10 codes are used, fatalities by time spent travelling vary within similar ranges for walking, cycling and driving. Risks for drivers were highest in youth and fell with age, while for pedestrians and cyclists, risks increased with age. For the young, especially males, cycling is safer than driving.},

  abstract = {Public health engineering emerged from the need to tackle cholera in the nineteenth century. Transport today is a challenge comparable to cholera in the nineteenth and air pollution in the twentieth century in its complexity, cost, engineering and health consequences. Engineers dealing with the 'low-carbon' transport agenda must contribute to carbon dioxide reduction targets as a matter of policy requirement. Cross-disciplinary synergies between low-carbon approaches and health are important to both policy fields. Transport is not an end in itself, but provides access to facilities, people, work, education and goods and can build physical activity into everyday life. Simultaneously, transport causes stress, disruption of communities, injuries and death, noise and air pollution, causing physical and mental ill-health, and is a major emitter of greenhouse gases. Benefits of motorised transport accrue particularly to the wealthy, while adverse effects fall disproportionately on the disadvantaged. Effective low-carbon policies must reduce the need to travel and promote modal shift as well as embracing technological advances. However, making transport carbon dioxide-free will neither offset all health issues nor deliver all quality-of-life requirements. This paper explores ways in which the low-carbon and health agendas are complementary, and where potential conflicts could arise.},

  abstract = {In many large Latin American urban areas such as the S\~ao Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR), growing social and economic inequalities are embedded through high spatial inequality in the provision of state schools and affordable public transport to these schools. This paper sheds light on the transport-education inequality nexus with reference to school accessibility by public transport in the SPMR. To assess school accessibility, we develop an accessibility index which combines information on the spatial distribution of adolescents, the location of existing schools, and the public transport provision serving the school catchment area into a single measure. The index is used to measure school accessibility locally across 633 areas within the SPMR. We use the index to simulate the impact of a policy aiming at increasing the centralisation of public secondary education provision, and find that it negatively affects public transport accessibility for students with the lowest levels of accessibility. These results illustrate how existing inequalities can be amplified by variable accessibility to schools across income groups and geographical space. The research suggests that educational inequality impacts of school agglomeration policies should be considered before centralisation takes place.},

We modeled the association between cycling network length and cycling mode share and estimated health impacts of the expansion of cycling networks. First, we performed a non-linear least square regression to assess the relationship between cycling network length and cycling mode share for 167 European cities. Second, we conducted a quantitative HIA for the seven cities of different scenarios (S) assessing how an expansion of the cycling network [i.e. 10\% (S1); 50\% (S2); 100\% (S3), and all-streets (S4)] would lead to an increase in cycling mode share and estimated mortality impacts thereof. We quantified mortality impacts for changes in physical activity, air pollution and traffic incidents. Third, we conducted a cost\textendash benefit analysis. The cycling network length was associated with a cycling mode share of up to 24.7\% in European cities. The all-streets scenario (S4) produced greatest benefits through increases in cycling for London with 1210 premature deaths (95\% CI: 447\textendash 1972) avoidable annually, followed by Rome (433; 95\% CI: 170\textendash 695), Barcelona (248; 95\% CI: 86\textendash 410), Vienna (146; 95\% CI: 40\textendash 252), Zurich (58; 95\% CI: 16\textendash 100) and Antwerp (7; 95\% CI: 3\textendash 11). The largest cost\textendash benefit ratios were found for the 10\% increase in cycling networks (S1). If all 167 European cities achieved a cycling mode share of 24.7\% over 10,000 premature deaths could be avoided annually. In European cities, expansions of cycling networks were associated with increases in cycling and estimated to provide health and economic benefits.},

The analysis shows that significantly wider passing distances are adopted by motorists in the condition without a 1.45m cycle lane, with posted speed limits of 40mph and 50mph with a 9.5m wide carriageway. These findings were not replicated for a similar width road with a posted speed limit of 30mph and a 1.3m cycle lane. The results suggest that in the presence of a cycle lane, drivers may be driving within the confines of their own marked lane with less recognition being given to the need to provide a comfortable passing distance to cycle traffic in the adjacent cycle lane.},

Two models of perceived risk, based on non-linear least squares, and a model of acceptability, based on the logit model, have been estimated for whole journeys based on responses from a sample of 144 commuters to video clips of routes and junctions. The risk models quantify the effect of motor traffic volumes, demonstrate that roundabouts add more to perceived risk than traffic signal controlled junctions and show that right turn manoeuvres increase perceived risk. Facilities for bicycle traffic along motor trafficked routes and at junctions are shown to have little effect on perceived risk and this brings into question the value of such facilities in promoting bicycle use. These models would assist in specifying infrastructure improvements, the recommending of least risk advisory routes and assessing accessibility for bicycle traffic. The acceptability model confirms the effect of reduced perceived risk in traffic free conditions and the effects of signal controlled junctions and right turns. The acceptability models, which may be used at an area wide level, would assist in assessing the potential demand for cycling and in target setting.},

  abstract = {Transportation research has usually seen road networks as inert systems to be navigated and eventually filled up by traffic. A new type of `configurational' road network modelling, coupled to detailed studies of vehicular and pedestrian flows, has shown that road networks have a much more constructive role. They strongly influence the pattern of flows through quantifiable properties of the network `configuration'. Recent research results are presented showing that rates of vehicular movement in road segments are to a greater extent than previously realised the direct outcome of the location of those segments in the network configuration as a whole and that this is the case especially in the fine structure of the urban grid. A supply and demand model of urban movement is proposed in which the degree to which a street alignment is on simplest routes between all other pairs of alignments in the system determines the demand side of the equation, and the effective road width available to traffic determines the supply side. Regression analysis shows that these two factors alone account for the majority of the variance in flows from street to street (r2 {$\sim$} 0.8). A model is then proposed of the evolution of the city in allocation of land uses to land parcels, and the allocation of capacity in the road network, where each reinforces the underlaying configurational logic through a feedback `multiplier' effect. These findings suggest the possibility of using urban design parameters, such as the plan configuration of the street grid, building height, and street width, to arrive at a better controlled relationship between vehicles and pedestrians in urban areas. As these design parameters are under the direct control of the urban master-planner, the new techniques lend themselves to application in design decision support. A case example of the application of these techniques in the master-planning of the redevelopment of London's South Bank cultural centre is presented.},

These comparisons always aim at measuring the accuracy with which the models reproduce the mobility described by origin-destination matrices. This has been done at different spatial scales using different datasets, and several versions of the models have been proposed to adjust to various spatial systems. However the models, to our knowledge, have never been compared with respect to policy testing scenarios. For this reason, here we use the models to analyze the impact of the introduction of a new transportation network, a Bus Rapid Transport system, in the city of Teresina in Brazil. We do this by measuring the estimated variation in the trip distribution, and formulate an accessibility to employment indicator for the different zones of the city. By comparing the results obtained with the two approaches, we are able, not only to better assess the goodness of fit and the impact of this intervention, but also to understand reasons for the systematic similarities and differences in their predictions.},

As traffic congestion has become severe in many large cities, especially in the developing world, other transport alternatives need to be considered and efficient public transport systems should be given utter priority as they have enormous environmental, social and commercial benefits. There are several options of public transport system. However, in recent times the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system option is fast catching up with developing countries. Accra has in recent years been grappling to put in place a public transport system. The BRT concept has been introduced and the World Bank has pledged to support it having ascertained its feasibility [1,2]. Inevitably, there has arisen the need to integrate cycling into the BRT system owing to the increasing use of bicycles in Accra. The integration will afford commuters the opportunity to combined different modes in the most efficient, time and cost-effective manner. This would therefore require strategic planning to link cycle routes to terminals on major route.},

  abstract = {There is a growing awareness that significant benefits for our health and environment could be achieved by reducing our use of cars and shifting instead to active transport, i.e. walking and bicycling. The present article presents an estimate of the health impacts due to a shift from car to bicycling or walking, by evaluating four effects: the change in exposure to ambient air pollution for the individuals who change their transportation mode, their health benefit, the health benefit for the general population due to reduced pollution and the risk of accidents. We consider only mortality in detail, but at the end of the paper we also cite costs for other impacts, especially noise and congestion. For the dispersion of air pollution from cars we use results of the Transport phase of the ExternE project series and derive general results that can be applied in different regions. We calculate the health benefits of bicycling and walking based on the most recent review by the World Health Organization. For a driver who switches to bicycling for a commute of 5 km (one way) 5 days/week 46 weeks/yr the health benefit from the physical activity is worth about 1300 \texteuro/yr, and in a large city (\&gt;500,000) the value of the associated reduction of air pollution is on the order of 30 \texteuro/yr. For the individual who makes the switch, the change in air pollution exposure and dose implies a loss of about 20 \texteuro/yr under our standard scenario but that is highly variable with details of the trajectories and could even have the opposite sign. The results for walking are similar. The increased accident risk for bicyclists is extremely dependent on the local context; data for Paris and Amsterdam imply that the loss due to fatal accidents is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the health benefit of the physical activity. An analysis of the uncertainties shows that the general conclusion about the order of magnitude of these effects is robust. The results can be used for cost-benefit analysis of programs or projects to increase active transport, provided one can estimate the number of individuals who make a mode shift.},

It was found that the model was able to accurately predict pedestrian flows (r-squared 0.81, p-value \&lt; 0.0001) after incorporating distance to transit stops and major tourist attractions. These findings suggest that in addition to estimating pedestrian volumes in geographic locations where data is not available, pedestrian volume modeling can also be useful for estimating pedestrian volumes in future conditions.

Starting from Alker Tripp's seminal ideas about city design, street morphology, and accident risk, this article summarizes results from an increasingly sophisticated line of enquiry at the boundaries between transport geography, network modeling, urban geography, and planning. It goes on to specify what we believe to be the most comprehensive study yet, based on five years' worth of road casualty data from London; GIS data on street morphology and physical features captured at a street-link unit of analysis; socio-economics and other determinants of accidents; and individual data about casualty victims. We test hypotheses about links between urban morphology and casualty severity using multi-level models with individual victim attributes at level-one, street-link morphology attributes (various measure of network connectivity) at level-two, and neighborhood descriptors at level-three.Results indicate that street-level morphology and design (expressed in terms of betweenness, divergence ratio, and hull radius), together with traffic volume and physical features of streets are all significantly associated with odds of ``Killed and Seriously Injured'' (KSI) causality incidents. We find the strongest evidence yet recorded that London's 20-MPH speed-restricted residential zones reduce the incidence of KSI; while neighborhood-level factors such as population density, deprivation of living environment, and access to services are also significant predictors of KSI indicating that selective urban territorial enclosure can save lives.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing active travel (primarily walking and cycling) has been widely advocated for reducing obesity levels and achieving other population health benefits. However, the strength of evidence underpinning this strategy is unclear. This study aimed to assess the evidence that active travel has significant health benefits. METHODS: The study design was a systematic review of (i) non-randomised and randomised controlled trials, and (ii) prospective observational studies examining either (a) the effects of interventions to promote active travel or (b) the association between active travel and health outcomes. Reports of studies were identified by searching 11 electronic databases, websites, reference lists and papers identified by experts in the field. Prospective observational and intervention studies measuring any health outcome of active travel in the general population were included. Studies of patient groups were excluded. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies from 12 countries were included, of which six were studies conducted with children. Five studies evaluated active travel interventions. Nineteen were prospective cohort studies which did not evaluate the impact of a specific intervention. No studies were identified with obesity as an outcome in adults; one of five prospective cohort studies in children found an association between obesity and active travel. Small positive effects on other health outcomes were found in five intervention studies, but these were all at risk of selection bias. Modest benefits for other health outcomes were identified in five prospective studies. There is suggestive evidence that active travel may have a positive effect on diabetes prevention, which may be an important area for future research. CONCLUSIONS: Active travel may have positive effects on health outcomes, but there is little robust evidence to date of the effectiveness of active transport interventions for reducing obesity. Future evaluations of such interventions should include an assessment of their impacts on obesity and other health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Determining and understanding the environmental factors contributing to road traffic accident occurrence is of core importance in road safety research. In this study, a methodology to obtain robust and unbiased results when modeling imbalanced, high-resolution accident data is described. Based on a data set covering the whole highway network of Austria in a fine spatial (250 m) and temporal (1 h) scale, the effects of 48 covariates on accident occurrence are analyzed, with a special emphasis on real-time weather variables obtained through meteorological re-analysis. A balanced bagging approach is employed to cope with the issue of class imbalance. By fitting different tree-based classifiers to a large number of bootstrapped training samples, ensembles of binary classification models are established. The final prediction is achieved through majority vote across each ensemble, resulting in a robust prediction with reduced variance. Findings show the merits of the proposed approach in terms of model quality and robustness of the results, consistently displaying accuracies around 80\% while exhibiting sensitivities of approximately 50\%. In addition to certain features related to roadway geometrics, surface condition and traffic volume, a number of weather variables are found to be of importance for predicting accident occurrence. The proposed methodological take may not only pave the way for further analyses of high-resolution road safety data including real-time information, but can also be transferred to any other imbalanced classification problem.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Long-term exposure to pollution can lead to an increase in the rate of decline of lung function, especially in older individuals and in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whereas shorter-term exposure at higher pollution levels has been implicated in causing excess deaths from ischaemic heart disease and exacerbations of COPD. We aimed to assess the effects on respiratory and cardiovascular responses of walking down a busy street with high levels of pollution compared with walking in a traffic-free area with lower pollution levels in older adults.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}In this randomised, crossover study, we recruited men and women aged 60 years and older with angiographically proven stable ischaemic heart disease or stage 2 Global initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) COPD who had been clinically stable for 6 months, and age-matched healthy volunteers. Individuals with ischaemic heart disease or COPD were recruited from existing databases or outpatient respiratory and cardiology clinics at the Royal Brompton \& Harefield NHS Foundation Trust and age-matched healthy volunteers using advertising and existing databases. All participants had abstained from smoking for at least 12 months and medications were taken as recommended by participants' doctors during the study. Participants were randomly assigned by drawing numbered disks at random from a bag to do a 2 h walk either along a commercial street in London (Oxford Street) or in an urban park (Hyde Park). Baseline measurements of participants were taken before the walk in the hospital laboratory. During each walk session, black carbon, particulate matter (PM) concentrations, ultrafine particles, and nitrogen dioxide (NO\textsubscript{2}) concentrations were measured.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Between October, 2012, and June, 2014, we screened 135 participants, of whom 40 healthy volunteers, 40 individuals with COPD, and 39 with ischaemic heart disease were recruited. Concentrations of black carbon, NO\textsubscript{2}, PM\textsubscript{10}, PM\textsubscript{2.5}, and ultrafine particles were higher on Oxford Street than in Hyde Park. Participants with COPD reported more cough (odds ratio [OR] 1{$\cdot$}95, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}96\textendash 3{$\cdot$}95; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}1), sputum (3{$\cdot$}15, 1{$\cdot$}39\textendash 7{$\cdot$}13; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}05), shortness of breath (1{$\cdot$}86, 0{$\cdot$}97\textendash 3{$\cdot$}57; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}1), and wheeze (4{$\cdot$}00, 1{$\cdot$}52\textendash 10{$\cdot$}50; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}05) after walking down Oxford Street compared with Hyde Park. In all participants, irrespective of their disease status, walking in Hyde Park led to an increase in lung function (forced expiratory volume in the first second [FEV\textsubscript{1}] and forced vital capacity [FVC]) and a decrease in pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index up to 26 h after the walk. By contrast, these beneficial responses were attenuated after walking on Oxford Street. In participants with COPD, a reduction in FEV\textsubscript{1} and FVC, and an increase in R5\textendash 20 were associated with an increase in during-walk exposure to NO\textsubscript{2}, ultrafine particles and PM\textsubscript{2.5}, and an increase in PWV and augmentation index with NO\textsubscript{2} and ultrafine particles. In healthy volunteers, PWV and augmentation index were associated both with black carbon and ultrafine particles.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Short-term exposure to traffic pollution prevents the beneficial cardiopulmonary effects of walking in people with COPD, ischaemic heart disease, and those free from chronic cardiopulmonary diseases.

In typically large households, the practice of fostering children, hiring domestic servants and doorstep petty trading by elderly women are three notable strategies for relieving middle-aged adults from transport stress and under-provision, and enabling them to be wage earners. As resources, rather than responsibilities, children fetch and carry, and attend school in shifts. From a transport activity or survival network approach, these elements can be viewed as key strategies in the organization of travel and transport.},

The Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model, which simulates feedbacks between meteorological variables and chemical species, is used as a photochemical modelling tool to describe the physico-chemical processes leading to the evolution of number and mass size distribution of particles through gas-to-particle conversion. A vehicular emission model based on statistical information of vehicular activity is applied to simulate vehicular emissions over the studied area. The simulation has been performed for a 1-month period (7 August\&ndash;6 September 2012) to cover the availability of experimental data from the NUANCE-SPS (Narrowing the Uncertainties on Aerosol and Climate Changes in Sao Paulo State) project that aims to characterize emissions of atmospheric aerosols in the SPMA. The availability of experimental measurements of atmospheric aerosols and the application of the WRF-Chem model made it possible to represent some of the most important properties of fine particles in the SPMA such as the mass size distribution and chemical composition, besides allowing us to evaluate its formation potential through the gas-to-particle conversion processes. Results show that the emission of primary gases, mostly from vehicles, led to a production of secondary particles between 20 and 30\% in relation to the total mass concentration of PM\textsubscript{2.5} in the downtown SPMA. Each of PM\textsubscript{2.5} and primary natural aerosol (dust and sea salt) contributed with 40\&ndash;50\% of the total PM\textsubscript{10} (i.e. those {$\leq$} 10\textmu m in diameter) concentration. Over 40\% of the formation of fine particles, by mass, was due to the emission of hydrocarbons, mainly aromatics. Furthermore, an increase in the number of small particles impaired the ultraviolet radiation and induced a decrease in ozone formation. The ground-level O\textsubscript{3} concentration decreased by about 2\% when the aerosol-radiation feedback is taken into account.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We therefore develop practical generalized additive model fitting methods for large data sets in the case in which the smooth terms in the model are represented by using penalized regression splines. The methods use iterative update schemes to obtain factors of the model matrix while requiring only subblocks of the model matrix to be computed at any one time. We show that efficient smoothing parameter estimation can be carried out in a well-justified manner. The grid load prediction problem requires updates of the model fit, as new data become available, and some means for dealing with residual auto-correlation in grid load. Methods are provided for these problems and parallel implementation is covered. The methods allow estimation of generalized additive models for large data sets by using modest computer hardware, and the grid load prediction problem illustrates the utility of reduced rank spline smoothing methods for dealing with complex modelling problems.},

The smoothers are constructed by a simple transformation and truncation of the basis that arises from the solution of the thin plate spline smoothing problem and are optimal in the sense that the truncation is designed to result in the minimum possible perturbation of the thin plate spline smoothing problem given the dimension of the basis used to construct the smoother. By making use of Lanczos iteration the basis change and truncation are computationally efficient. The smoothers allow the use of approximate thin plate spline models with large data sets, avoid the problems that are associated with `knot placement' that usually complicate modelling with regression splines or penalized regression splines, provide a sensible way of modelling interaction terms in generalized additive models, provide low rank approximations to generalized smoothing spline models, appropriate for use with large data sets, provide a means for incorporating smooth functions of more than one variable into non-linear models and improve the computational efficiency of penalized likelihood models incorporating thin plate splines. Given that the approach produces spline-like models with a sparse basis, it also provides a natural way of incorporating unpenalized spline-like terms in linear and generalized linear models, and these can be treated just like any other model terms from the point of view of model selection, inference and diagnostics.},

Changes to carbon dioxide emissions were estimated by environmental modelling. Health impact assessment modelling was used to estimate changes in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) resulting from changes in exposure to air pollution, road traffic injury risk, and physical activity. We compare the findings of the model with results generated using the World Health Organization's Health Economic Assessment of Transport (HEAT) tools.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nRESULTS: This study found considerable reductions in disease burden under all three scenarios, with the largest health benefits attributed to reductions in ischemic heart disease. The pathways that produced the largest benefits were, in order, physical activity, road traffic injuries, and air pollution. The choice of dose response relationship for physical activity had a large impact on the size of the benefits. Modelling the impact on all-cause mortality rather than through individual diseases suggested larger benefits. Using the best available evidence we found fewer road traffic injuries for all scenarios compared with baseline but alternative assumptions suggested potential increases.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: Methods to estimate the health impacts from transport related physical activity and injury risk are in their infancy; this study has demonstrated an integration of transport and health impact modelling approaches. The findings add to the case for a move from car transport to walking and cycling, and have implications for empirical and modelling research.},
